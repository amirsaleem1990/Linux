class Enum:

    The constructor and the method .ints(names) take a list of variable names,
    and assign them consecutive integers as values.    The method .strs(names)
    assigns each variable name to itself (that is variable 'v' has value 'v').
    The method .vals(a=99, b=200) allows you to assign any value to variables.
    A 'list of variable names' can also be a string, which will be .split().
    The method .end() returns one more than the maximum int value.
    Example: opcodes = Enum("add sub load store").vals(illegal=255)."""
