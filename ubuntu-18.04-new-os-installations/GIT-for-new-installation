>>> cat /home/amir/.ssh/config 
# Default GitHub (first account)
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    IdentitiesOnly yes

# Turing account (second)
Host github-turing
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_turing
    IdentitiesOnly yes





The above is from my old setup, as /home/amir/.ssh is a symlink.
So in the above I have two github accounts: github, and github-turing
What I have to do now is to go to EVERY LOCAL repo that belong to my personal github, and run:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:amirsaleem1990/$(basename $(pwd)).git

And then go to EVERY LOCAL repo that belong to Turing github, and run:
git remote set-url origin git@github-turing:amirsaleemturing/$(basename $(pwd)).git
