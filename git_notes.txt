>>> Pull From a Remote Repository:                   git pull & git fetch
>>> All local branches:                              git branch
>>> All remote branches:                             git branch -r
>>> All local and remote branches:                   git branch -a

>>> Create a New Branch:                             git checkout -b my-branch-name

>>> Switch to a Branch In Your Local Repo:           git checkout my-branch-name

>>> Switch to a Branch That Came From a Remote Repo: git checkout --track origin/my-branch-name

>>> Push to a Branch
   If your local branch does not exist on the remote, run either of these commands:
      git push -u origin my-branch-name
      git push -u origin HEAD

      NOTE: HEAD is a reference to the top of the current branch, so it's an easy way to push to a branch of the same name on the remote. This saves you from having to type out the exact name of the branch!
   
   If your local branch already exists on the remote, run this command:
      git push

Merge a Branch
   1. You'll want to make sure your working tree is clean and see what branch you're on. Run this command:
      git status
   2. First, you must check out the branch that you want to merge another branch into (changes will be merged into this branch). If you're not already on the desired branch, run this command:
      git checkout master
      NOTE: Replace master with another branch name as needed.
   3. Now you can merge another branch into the current branch. Run this command:
      git merge my-branch-name
      NOTE: When you merge, there may be a conflict. Refer to Handling Merge Conflicts (the next exercise) to learn what to do.

Delete Branches
   To delete a remote branch, run this command:
      git push origin --delete my-branch-name
   To delete a local branch, run either of these commands:
      git branch -d my-branch-name
      git branch -D my-branch-name
   NOTE: The -d option only deletes the branch if it has already been merged. The -D option is a shortcut for --delete --force, which deletes the branch irrespective of its merged status.
