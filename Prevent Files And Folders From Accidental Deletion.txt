    The operator ‘+’ causes the selected attributes to be added to the existing attributes of the files;
    The operator ‘-‘ causes them to be removed;
    The operator ‘=’ causes them to be the only attributes that the files have.

Chattr has different attributes namely – aAcCdDeijsStTu. Each letter applies a particular attributes to a file.

    a – append only,
    A – no atime updates,
    c – compressed,
    C – no copy on write,
    d – no dump,
    D – synchronous directory updates,
    e – extent format,
    i – immutable,
    j – data journalling,
    P – project hierarchy,
    s – secure deletion,
    S – synchronous updates,
    t – no tail-merging,
    T – top of directory hierarchy,
    u – undeletable.


> touch file.txt
# apply “i” attribute which makes the file immutable. It means you can’t delete, modify the file, > even if you’re the file owner and the root user.
> sudo chattr +i file.txt
> sudo rm file.txt
## rm: cannot remove 'file.txt': Operation not permitted
> echo 'Hello World!' >> file.txt
## bash: file.txt: Operation not permitted

# To revoke attributes, just use “-i” switch as shown below.
> sudo chattr -i file.txt
> rm file.txt


Prevent folders from accidental deletion and modification

> mkdir dir1 && touch dir1/file.txt

# Now, make this directory and its contents (file.txt) immutable using command:
> sudo chattr -R +i dir1
    -R – will make the dir1 and its contents immutable recursively.
    +i – makes the directory immutable.

# Now, try to delete the directory.
> sudo rm -fr dir1
## rm: cannot remove 'dir1/file.txt': Operation not permitted

# To revoke the attributes back, run:
> sudo chattr -R -i dir1


Prevent files and folders from accidental deletion, but allow append operation

For files:
> sudo chattr +a file.txt

For directories: 
> sudo chattr -R +a dir1


# To remove the attributes, run the following commands:
For files:
$ sudo chattr -R -a file.txt

For directories: 
$ sudo chattr -R -a dir1/

Now, you can delete or modify the files and folders as usual.
