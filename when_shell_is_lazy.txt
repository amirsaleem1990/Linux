1-Downloading a small file more faster in browser than from cammand line via curl or wget.
2- cut and paste from mobile to computer is more more dificult and very slow via command line, and very easy and quick via x-windows nautilus.
3- seach via command line (using <find>) is lazy compared to searh in gnome, (i use this syntax to search a file <find . -name my_key_word>)........ Note: this is true for <find>, there is another tool for find a file which is <locate> and it is more faster than <find>
